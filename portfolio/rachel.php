				<h4>About the Client</h4>
				<p>Rachel Barkley is the worship leader at GTAustin. God has given Rachel a passion for His presence and gift for music. Her current project “Treasures of Darkness” is inspired by Isaiah 45:3 where God promises to give us treasures hidden in darkness.</p>

				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>I serve on the worship team with Rachel and wanted to use my web development skills as a way to give back for all her leadership she's given to the church and myself. I wanted a website that she could easily update, which is why I chose Wordpress, while still capturing the style of her music and personality.</p>
