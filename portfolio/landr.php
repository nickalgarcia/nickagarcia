						<h4>About the Client</h4>
						<p>L & R Signs is an Austin sign company started by Larry and Rachel Davis in 2014. At the beginning of the business, Larry reached out to me about helping them to create a website for their business. They wanted a website that would be easy for customers to contact them for a quote. The website files are stored on GitHub and pushed live using DeployBot. Since their site is more static, this made more sense to have the client hands off from making updates.</p>

						<h4>Details</h4>
						<p>Since they are a new business, they didn't want to lose that personal contact by having the client get a quote through the website. We decided to use JotForm to create their contact form. JotForm offered the ability to upload an image which was important to Larry since his business is visual.</p>
