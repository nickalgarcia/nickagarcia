						<h4>About the Client</h4>
		<p>Laura Freeman created Hey Lolly Music to be an interactive and educational experience for children through music and puppetry. The previous website was very dated with a poor user experience. With design provided by Kara Fuhlbrugge from <a href="http://cmykara.com" target="_blank">cmykara.com</a>, we were able to create a site that is both visually appealing as well as easy to navigate.</p>

						<h4>Details</h4>
		<p>A single page website seemed most appropriate for Hey Lolly Music. After speaking with Laura, we found out that most of the people that view he sites are moms looking for information. Rather than having them click through multiple pages, presenting all of the info in one place while still providing a great user experience seemed the best choice. The website is built through Wordpress using custom functionality.</p>
