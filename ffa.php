		<h2>Fund for Animals</h2>
		<p>The Fund for Animals was founded in 1967 by prominent author and animal advocate Cleveland Amory. For more than four decades, The Fund has spearheaded significant events in the history of the animal protection movement by employing national advocacy campaigns, rescue operations and operating a network of world-famous animal care facilities like our Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch.</p>
		<p>Fund for the Animals is an affiliate site of the Humane Society. This project was a complete responsive redesign. Their site already lived in the Luminate Online CMS so the project consisted of creating a new wrapper, content types, display templates, and conditionals for content throughout the site. I used the Bootstrap framework to match the design the client sent.</p>
