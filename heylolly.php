		<h2>Hey Lolly Music</h2>
		<p>Laura Freeman created Hey Lolly Music to be an interactive and educational experience for children through music and puppetry. The previous website was very dated with a poor user experience. With design provided by Kara Fuhlbrugge from <a href="http://cmykara.com">cmykara.com</a>, we were able to create a site that is both visually appealing as well as easy to navigate.</p>
		<p>A single page website seemed most appropriate for Hey Lolly Music.</p>
