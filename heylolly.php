						<h4>About the Client</h4>
		<p>Laura Freeman created Hey Lolly Music to be an interactive and educational experience for children through music and puppetry. The previous website was very dated with a poor user experience. With design provided by Kara Fuhlbrugge from <a href="http://cmykara.com" target="_blank">cmykara.com</a>, we were able to create a site that is both visually appealing as well as easy to navigate.</p>

						<h4>Details</h4>
		<p>A single page website seemed most appropriate for Hey Lolly Music.</p>
