						<h4>Details</h4>
		<p>When Michael Bell, owner of Bell Media Group, approached me about creating a website, he wanted a site that would incorporate video since their business is mostly video production. They also wanted a site that they could make updates on their own. So we decided on using Wordpress for their website.</p>
